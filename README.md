TIMEStoriesPODSoundtrack (TSPODS) is a simple program that plays background music for the various locations you will travel to in the TIME Stories expansion Prophecy of Dragons.

It is designed to be discreet so as not to spoil what a location may hold. In the command line, type the name of the location you are visiting as an argument and the program will open the corresponding background music in Chrome.

Examples:
python tspod.py base		#<-- Plays the music of the "Base" location
python tspod.py location 2	#<-- Plays the music for "Location 2"
python tspod.py 2			#<-- Also plays the music for "Location 2"

The Google Chrome webdriver may need to be installed to be able to open the browser.
